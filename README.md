## What it does?
The idea came when my taskbar and my desktop started to feel "overfloated" with shortcuts, so I tought "what if I could put them all on just one app?" and this is shortcut manager!
Here is an example of how I use it:
| Dark Theme | White Theme |

## How it does?
### Adding a shortcut
First you need to decide if you want to add a shortcut to a local app or an website, after that you'll see one of theese windows:
If you'll add a app you have to provide:
- The name of the shortcut, if you leave it empty it'll get the name of the app you chosen
- The path to the app you chosen
- Optionally: The icon that will show up on the app

And if you'll add a website, you have to provide:
- The name of the shortcut
- The link to the website, with or without https://, www, etc... but requires ".com" or ".org" at the end
- Optionally: The browser you'll want the window to open (default chrome)
- Optionally: The icon that will show up on the app

And thats it! now you can start your apps right from here, and leave your desktop and taskbar to more important things!
